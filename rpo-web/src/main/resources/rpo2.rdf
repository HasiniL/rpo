        <abstract rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Abstract—Data-driven decision support systems, such as data
warehouses can serve the requirement of extraction of
information from more than one subject area. Data warehouses
standardize the data across the organization so as to have a
single view of information. Data warehouses can provide the
information required by the decision makers. Developing a data
warehouse for educational institute is the less focused area since
educational institutes are non-profit and service oriented
organizations. In present day scenario where education has
been privatized and cut throat competition is prevailing,
institutes needs to be more organized and need to take better
decisions. Institute’s enrollments are increasing as a result of
increase in the number of branches and intake. Now a day, any
reputed Institute’s enrollments count in to thousands. In view of
these factors the challenges for the management are meeting the
diverse needs of students and facing increased complexity in
academic processes. The complexity of these challenges requires
continual improvements in operational strategies based on
accurate, timely and consistent information. The cost of
building a data warehouse is expensive for any educational
institution as it requires data warehouse tools for building data
warehouse and extracting data using data mining tools from
data warehouse.</abstract>
        <conclusion rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Justifying a data warehouse project can be very difficult.
Usually, analysis of the success of the data warehouse project
is done considering the financial benefits against the
investment. Since most of the educational institutes are
nonprofit organizations and service oriented, the evaluation
of the usefulness of the data warehouse can be done on the
basis of its ability to meet user’s requirements. The academic
data which was spread all across different sources has been
loaded into single platform. The decision makers can extract
information regarding three main components of the institute,
namely Employees, Students and Infrastructure. Employee
data mart can provide the users with the information such as
career growth and attrition rate. Student mart can provide the
information related to the student like best outgoing student
considering his academic and non academic activities.
Information regarding assets such as the investment in a
particular financial year can also be accessed. In educational
institute, decision makers ask “What are the expected results
and benefits?” when making a data warehouse project rather
than “What is the anticipated return on investment?”. The
data warehouse developed has met their expectations.
Benefits of the present project can be more if the Institute has
positive approach towards new technologies. They can take
micro-level decisions in a timely manner without the need to
depend on their IT staff.</conclusion>
        <introduction rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Now a day, the educational institutes have to generate
funds for their research and other operational activities as the
government funding has been limited to aided institutes.
Utilizing a decision support system is a proactive way to use
data to manage, operate, and evaluate educational institute in
a better way. Depending on the quality and availability of the
underlying data, such a system could address a wide range of
problems by distilling data from any combination of
education records maintenance system. The data mining from
data warehouse can be a ready and effective system for the
decision makers. A data warehouse is a subject oriented integrated, non-volatile, and time variant collection of data in
support of management decisions [1].Data warehouse
obtains the data from a number of operational data base
systems which can be based on RDBMS/ERP package, etc.
The data from these sources are converted into a form
suitable for data warehouse. This process is called Extraction,
Transformation and Loading (ETL). In addition to the target
database, there will be another database to store the metadata,
called the metadata repository. This data base contains data
about data-description of source data, target data and how the
source data has been modified into target data. The client
software will be used to generate reports.</introduction>

        <methodology rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Motivation for building data warehouse for the educational
institute is from two sources, internal sources like inability of
current operational systems to provide required information
for parameter driven analysis and external sources like
competitive factors. A survey is carried out by visiting
several educational institutes to gather information regarding
the current practices the institutes have implemented as
decision support systems. The findings are summarized
below.
1) The data is stored in different sources in distributed
locations.
2) Users find difficulty in locating the reports needed by
them.
3) The user interface for the current operational system is not
satisfactory and is confusing and hard to use for
decision makers.
4) When the consolidated report from two or more different
subject area is required, it is almost impossible.
5) There is no easy way to get assistance.
Utilizing a decision support system is a proactive way to
use data to manage, operate, and evaluate educational
institute in a better way. Depending on the quality and
availability of the underlying data, such a system could
address a wide range of problems by distilling data from any
combination of education records maintenance system. The
purpose of this paper is to investigate current system of
information delivery and propose a better system for timely,


V. BI-REPORTING
This refers to the variety of capabilities that can be
provided to the users to leverage the presentation area for
analytic decision making. All data access tools query the data
in the data warehouse presentation area. A data access tool
can be as simple as an ad hoc query tool or as complex as
sophisticated data mining application. The majority of the
users use pre-built parameter driven analytic applications to
access the data. This enables them to retrieve the required
information and analyze hidden pattern in the retrieved data
[11].Using suitable data mining techniques, the useful
information can be extracted from the data warehouse. Data
mining form three main components of the institute, namely
Employees, Students and Infrastructure. Employee data mart
can provide the users with the information such as career
growth and attrition rate. Student mart can provide the
information related to the student like best outgoing student
considering his academic and non academic activities.
Information regarding assets such as the investment in a
particular financial year can also be accessed.</methodology>
