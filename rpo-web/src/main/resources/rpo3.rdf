        <abstract rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Trajectory means a path followed by a moving
vehicles or object. Spatio temporal clustering is a process of
grouping objects based on their spatial or temporal similarity. It is
also known as Trajectory or mobility data. Existing work have
mainly focused on moving object is completely based on clustering
algorithms which only gives us that at any particular time how
many vehicles are present at any particular location, but it does
not generate any useful patterns.
In this project we deal with the analysis, pre processing and
modeling of traffic data in moving object database for traffic
management system. And we are using clustering techniques after
that we are classifying our data set to generate useful patterns
using C 4.5 Algorithm.
In clustering we are using Incremental DBSCAN algorithms
because as we know moving data always gets updated these data
are dynamic in nature</abstract>
        <conclusion rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Our work focuses to manage and maintain traffic systems
or for diverting traffic under certain emergency
circumstances or for tracking peoples movement in mall to
get popularity of mall.
For this firstly we are clustering our data set and after that
we are going to perform classification on that, because by
doing only clustering we can not get any useful patterns
only we can get is at any particular time how many vehicles
are present at any location and their directions but by this it 
is not possible to get useful patterns only we can do is to
compare the performance of various clustering algorithms.
So after clustering we are going to classify our data set,
which will help us to generate useful patterns. After this we
will compare the result of clustering and classification and
try to generate useful patterns, and check the accuracy of
both.</conclusion>
        <introduction rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The comprehension of phenomena related to movement not
only of people and vehicles but also of animals and other
moving objects – has always been a key issue in many areas
of scientific investigation or social analysis. Many
applications track the movement of mobile objects, using
location- acquisition technologies such as Global
Positioning System (GPS), Global System for Mobile
Communications (GSM) etc., and it can be represented as
sequences of time stamped locations.

TD consists of movements of objects, which record their
position as it evolves over time, the concept of uncertainty
appears in various ways; data imprecision due to sampling
and/or measurement errors, uncertainty in querying and
answering, fuzziness by purpose during pre-processing for
preserving anonymity, and so on. Although uncertainty is
inherent in TD, to the best of our knowledge there is no
related work in the database literature that studies its effect
in the knowledge discovery process.
The distance functions and indexing methods proposed for
one-dimensional time series data a not be directly applied to
moving object trajectories due to their unique
characteristics
Trajectories are usually two or three dimensional data
sequences and a trajectory data set often contain
trajectories with different lengths. Most of the earlier
proposals on similarity-based time series data retrieval
are focused on one-dimensional time series data Trajectories usually have many outliers. Unlike stock,
weather, or commodity price data, trajectories of moving objects are captured by recording the positions
of the objects from time to time (or tracing moving
objects from frame-to-frame in videos). Thus, due to
sensor failures, disturbance signals or errors in
detection techniques, many outliers may appear.
Longest Common Subsequences (LCSS) has been
applied to address this problem; however, it does not
consider various gaps between similar subsequences,
which lead to inaccuracy. The gap refers to a subtrajectory
in between two identified similar
components of two trajectories.</introduction>

        <methodology rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Incremental’ means changes in the existing database i.e.
insertion of new data into the database or deletion of old
data from the database. This is sometimes called ‘% of delta
change in the database’. This is a very important issue now
a day. Because at present most of the databases are dynamic
in nature. So, we need to develop some new data mining
techniques (algorithms) which can handle this dynamic
feature of the database efficiently and effectively. The
objective of incremental data mining algorithms is to
minimize the scanning and calculation effort for newly
added records. Here we improve the efficiency of newly
added record updating problem. These are the few prime
factors that cause to apply the incremental Mining.

Database always gets modified.
During each modification (insertion and deletion) the
database requires scanning again. Thus it requires lot of
time for rescanning.
Hence, the Incremental version of clustering algorithm
includes the logic for Insertion and Deletion as separate
Dynamic operation.
Whenever, the databases may have frequent updates
and thus it may be dynamic.
After insertions and deletions to the database, the
existing clustering algorithm has to be updated.
After that it can be expected algorithm of incremental
approach performs efficiently compare to actual

DBSCAN (DENSITY BASED SPATIAL CLUSTERING OF
APPLICATIONS WITH NOISE)
In this section, DBSCAN (density based spatial clustering
of applications with noise) is a density based approach to
cluster data of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN is based on two
main concepts: density reachability and density
connectability. These both concepts depend on two input
parameters of the dbscan clustering: the size of epsilon
neighborhood e and the minimum points in a cluster m.
DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports
the user in determining an appropriate value for it[5]. We
performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness
and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real
data. DBSCAN is efficient even for large spatial
database[3].
DBSCAN uses the same values for all clusters. The density
parameters of the “thinnest” cluster are good candidates for
these global parameter values specifying the lowest density
which is not considered to be noise

DBSCAN Clustering
DBSCAN clustering One of the most common clustering
algorithms and also most cited in scientific literature is
Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with
Noise (DBSCAN) which has the ability to produce arbitrary
shape of clusters. Clusters are identified by looking at the
density of points. Regions with a high density of points
depict the existence of clusters whereas regions with a low
density of points indicate clusters of noise or clusters of
outliers. DBSCAN grows clusters according to a density
based connectivity analysis. It defines a cluster as a
maximal set of density-connected points. The key idea of
density-based clustering is that for each object of a cluster
the neighborhood of a given radius ( ) has to contain at least
a minimum number of objects (MinPts), i.e. the cardinality
of the neighborhood has to exceed some threshold
one</methodology>
